# code-club

Coding club is an environment for devs to pool together their knowledge and become better devs through learning from each other's strengths. It is a playground to explore new or existing technologies whether it be a language, framework/library, tool or design pattern.

Because there's a diverse range in skill level among devs, one of the challenges will be finding the appropriate material that will be stimulating enough so that everyone will benefit from attending meetings.

Club rules
==========
1. Judgment free zone - there are no dumb questions, responses or statements. It is ok to make mistakes or to fail. There is no pressure to solve a problem or to give a talk.
2. Feedback - positive or constructive criticism is encouraged. Feedback can be about the meetings, people giving lessons, or even in pair coding exercises. If someone is giving a lesson, give praise if they did something well but more importantly, if you see any areas of improvement, let them know. It's the only way to get better.
3. Discussion is encouraged. If at the end of a lesson, someone asks a question that you know the answer to, feel free to weigh in.
4. Meetings are estimated to run for about 1-1.5 hrs. The time will most likely change once we find the right balance. Feel free to drop in or leave at any time.
5. Teaching - whether it be sharing your knowledge to your partner in pair coding or giving a talk, teaching not only empowers your colleagues but helps solidify your own understanding. [Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RleN-6uMF04&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeGY3RMjGo4CgMPN42_U9Glu&index=3) for good reasons why we should all teach.

Agenda
======

Each meeting will follow an agenda that tackles various aspects of coding and each meeting could be based on a theme like 'ES6' or 'SASS' or 'React'. The following is just a list of things we could do in a meeting, not a schedule.

- pair programming (15 min): everyone gets given the same code exercise or we could have easy/intermediate/advanced exercises to choose from to cater for various skill levels. Exercises could be as simple as writing a function that removes duplicates in an array to writing a React component. TDD could be employed. Ideally, you would choose someone you haven't paired with in the past. At times, you may choose to pair with someone at a similar/better skill level to learn whilst other times, you may choose to pair with someone more junior to practice teaching. See [Code wars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) or [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) for examples.

- lessons (5 min demo/20 min deep dives): whether it be a cool new trick you discovered like a handy function in Enzyme or a debugging devtool feature, this is the place to show everyone. Alternatively, you could do a 'deep dive'/intro/'code along'/talk/workshop on something you're keen on or have been working on at domain. For heavy topics, you could spread this out over several meetings in 20 min bite size chunks to give you more time to prepare each week. Giving lessons is a good way to practice explaining technical concepts as well as challenges people to new ways of thinking. Sharing is caring :)

- tutorials/building (20 min): if there's no one giving a lesson, we can look at an online tutorial and build something together. People are free to choose whatever they want to build or can follow one of the tutorials someone has found.  See [Node school](https://nodeschool.io/) or [React Status](https://react.statuscode.com/) for examples.

- domain specific (5 - 20 min): sometimes when reading a PR, you come across something that blows your mind or exemplifies good coding practices. For example, the way a component was structured, or the way the tests were written. Can also be a codebase deep dive. Personally, I'd love to see deep dives into how fe-build/fe-brary/fe-co-demo works.

- code kata (20 min): this is like pair programming where there is an exercise but only 1 person does the typing and everyone else comes up with ideas on how to solve the problem. If the person typing draws a mental blank or doesn't understand someone's idea, another person can take over. See http://codekata.com/ for example exercises.

- brain teaser (5 min): to keep things fun, this could be asked at the start of the meeting and the answer given in the next meeting
